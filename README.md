Development Process
Planning: Defined key functionalities, created wireframes, and set up the initial architecture.
Implementation:
Week 1: Set up database and API structure.
Week 2: Integrated front-end with API for product and user management.
Week 3: Implemented responsive design using TailwindCSS and connected Strapi for CMS.
Week 4: Conducted testing, debugging, and final deployment.
Testing: Performed tests on major user flows to ensure smooth operation across devices.
Challenges & Solutions
Time Constraints: Managed by setting up a strict timeline using a Kanban board for progress tracking.
Data Security: Used secure APIs and ensured data encryption for sensitive information.
Strapi Integration: Strapi was initially challenging to integrate, but we resolved this through extensive documentation review and API adjustments.
Future Enhancements
Enhanced Search: Implement a robust search functionality for users to find products easily.
Improved User Interface: Continue refining the UI for a more dynamic experience.
Order Tracking: Provide order status updates and notifications for users.
Security Enhancements: Additional measures for data protection, including encrypted user sessions.
